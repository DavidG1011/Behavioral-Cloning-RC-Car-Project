## Purpose:

This is to document the ongoing progress of building and training an RC car to drive itself using the open source Donkeycar platform. The Donkeycar repo is located [here](https://github.com/wroscoe/donkey).

## Origin: 

I originally wanted to start this project for 2 reasons.
- I have always been interested in robotics, so I felt this would be a great project to experiment with.

- I really enjoyed the behavioral cloning project I completed as part of my Udacity nanodegree program, and thought it would
be cool to work with the same theory on a tangible project. My behavioral cloning project can be found [here](https://github.com/DavidG1011/Udacity-Behavioral-Cloning---P3).

## Electronic Parts:

- 1/16 2.4Ghz Exceed RC Blaze.
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
- SunFounder PCA9685 16 Channel 12 Bit PWM Servo Driver.
- SainSmart Wide Angle Fish-Eye RPi Camera.
- Maxmoral 10cm Dupont Female to Female Jumper Wire.
- 6700mAh Anker Astro E1 Power Bank.

## Structural Parts:

- Masonite.
- Velcro Cable Ties.
- Shell cover from D-Link KVM switch.
- RC car chassis.
